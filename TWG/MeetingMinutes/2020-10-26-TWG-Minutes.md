TWG meeting minutes
October 26, 2020


++ Topic 1: LLVM tools for CVA6 presented by Zbigniew Chamski
https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/TWG/MeetingPresentations/2020-10-26%20LLVM-PPL-slides.pdf


The presentation by Zgibniew stressed that while GCC compiler uses a copyleft license, the LLVM tools are built around Apache 2.0. That provides commerical advantages to companies investing in enhancements.

There was interest in not only CVA6 but also CVE4 support for LLVM.

A PPL was not actually presented as it was not available for the meeting. Suggested that a compiled PPL/PL could be presented at subsequent TWG meeting.


++ Topic 2: FORCE-RISCV PL propoal by Leo Wang
https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/program/FORCE-RISCV%20ISG%20project%20proposal.md

Thales, Embecosm, and Imperas all agree to be written as project supporters without necc implying resource commitment on the coding. Duncan to work with Leo to update the section name to ensure this is reflected.

A key point was raised by Simon Davidmann concerning actual integration of FORCE-RISCV with the OpenHW UVM testbench. Simon, Mike and Leo agreed to scope the effort required.
The project plan presented should be adapted to reflect this.

However, the proposal to move this project to the PROJECT LAUNCH (PL) gate was accepted.
