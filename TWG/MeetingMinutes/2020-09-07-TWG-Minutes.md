## Notes:

Topics:

1. OpenHW Group Website upcoming changes

- Duncan proposed changes for OpenHW Group website:
  - Focus on repositories instead of projects
  - Add a project page after we have well-described OTPs (OpenHW Technical Project)
- After discussion, team suggested to simplify the proposal:
  - consolidate WG / project / repo pages into a simple webpage which links to Github repositories
  - provide an overview for each project -- link to the md file

2. FORCE-RISCV

- Leo presented the proposal of this ISG tool to TWG:
  - This tool currently supports 64-bit version of RISC-V, 32-bit version of RISC-V support is on-going by Hongkong City University.
  - This tool can be OpenHW group's ISG tool to support CVA6 & CV64A & CV32E cores

- No concerns or objection.
