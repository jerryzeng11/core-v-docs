# OpenHW Preliminary Project Proposal
This is a combined proposal for PPL and PL gates of the CV32E40X project

# Title of Project
CV32E40X

## Summary of project
This project involves the creation and verification of the CV32E40X core. This is an evolution of the CV32E40P core.
CV32E40X is a 4-stage RISC-V core aimed at compute intensive applications supporting the RV32IM[A]C[B][P]XZce_Zicount_Zicsr_Zifencei instruction set
Key features: P, B, general purpose accelerator interface.

Key application areas
* Medium performance compute intensive applications
* Accelerator interfacing

High level compute features
* P, B extensions
* Accelerator interface (X)

### Components

The project builds on CV32E40P as a baseline and it shares the following new features with CV32E40S:

* PMA
* Zce extension
* Extended debug functionality
* Simplified pipeline and controller
* Smarter prefetch unit (fewer unneeded prefetches)
* Register file optimization (remove 2nd write port, 3rd read port; except when P/B included)
* ALU/MUL clean up
* Faster (mulh*) multiply
* fence.i interface
* mtval support
* Bus error support
* RVFI interface (bound to RTL, not part of actual RTL)

The scope of project is similar to CV32E40P. It consists of design enhancements, verification, and documentation.

Software compiler support will be handled in related OpenHW projects, not yet defined. No custom instructions will be added and as such software compiler support is expected to be minimal (if not zero). Tool chain support is however required for the deliverable in which we will show how an example instruction can be added in an accelerator connected to the extension interface; this example will also describe and provide the related modifications to assembler/disassembler, etc.

Support for the (not-yet-ratified) Zce extension would be very welcome from the Software TG, but this PPL/PL does not assume that this will happen. Similarly it is understood that especially for the (also not-yet-ratified) P extension no compiler support is existing.

As of yet any plans to develop OpenHW hardware reference designs such as FPGA or SoC have not been defined.

#### Component 1 - RTL design

The following design aspects of the project are required:

* PMA (configurable number of regions)
* Zce extension
* A extension
* B extension (configurable all or nothing)
* P extension (configurable all or nothing)
* X interface
* Extended debug functionality
* Simplified pipeline and controller
* Smarter prefetch unit (fewer unneeded prefetches)
* Register file optimization (remove 2nd write port, 3rd read port; except when P/B included)
* ALU/MUL clean up
* Faster divide
* Faster (mulh*) multiply
* fence.i interface
* mtval support
* Interruptible div/divu/rem/remu
* Bus error support
* RVFI interface (bound to RTL, not part of actual RTL)

#### Component 2 

The verification approach is based on that developed for the CV32E40P.

A similar verification approach as for the CV32E40P will be used (UVM, lock step ISS, formal techniques, random code generation, etc.) with the major improvement being a bound RVFI interface to the RTL and an RVVI interface towards the ISS to ease the integration of the core with the verification environment (the RVFI->RVVI scoreboard/adapter is outside the scope of this project). The Imperas ISS will be extended with the new (software visible) features once ratified or deemed stable enough (e.g. User mode, ePMP, Zce, bus error support).

## Explanation of why OpenHW should do this project

Enables benefiting from standard RISC-V tool support plus allows for custom extensions without the need to change the core. Beneficial for member companies (enables a business/support model for members as Embecosm, Imperas and OneSpin; allows for (non-public) vendor specific extensions) as well as wider ecosystem (e.g. custom accelerator design matching standardized interface).

## Industry landscape: description of competing, alternative, or related efforts in the industry

CV32E40P, ARM Cortex-M4/M7

## External dependencies

Zce, P, B, 0.14 Debug specifications have not been ratified yet by RISC-V. Will be deconfigured or postponed if needed.

## List of project outputs

## TGs Impacted/Resource requirements

* Cores TG
* Verification TG
* Software TG

Resource requirements covered within Silicon Labs, Embecosm, Imperas, University of Bologna, ETH Zurich.

## OpenHW engineering staff resource plan: requirement and availability

* Consultancy (answering questions from Project Team on existing RTL or verification infrastructure; likely very minimal)
* Metrics CI support (in principle Project Team will stick mostly to the Cadence world; here we request any Metrics CI work as was done for the 40P)
* Core independent ISS adapter (design of the RVFI->RVVI scoreboard/adapter. The assumption is that a bound RVFI interface is added to the CV32E40P first and that the RVFI->RVVI scoreboard/adapter is specified and designed in the CV32E40P project as well.). The RVFI->RVVI scoreboard/adapter should then be re-usable as-is for the CV32E40X and the Project Team only needs to add a bound RVFI interface to the CV32E40X)
* X interface implementation (optionally to be done by OpenHW Staff, if not by Project Team)
