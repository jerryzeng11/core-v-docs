# Software TG Report December 2020

Presented to TWG meeting 21 December 2020.

## Overview

Four projects in progress

* **IDE:** Passed PPL gate
* **GNU Tools:** Passed PPL gate
* **Clang/LLVM Tools:** Passed PPL gate
* **FreeRTOS:** Passed PPL gate

## IDE project

Project lead: Alexander Fedorov

### Progress in current month

* Have initial release upstream
* Initial suggestions for sample applications to improve IDE
* Meeting held to discuss full project launch

### Statistics

None yet available

### Risk register update

1. **Risk:** Difficulty identifying candidate projects to include as examples

   - risk reduced as initial suggestions coming forward, but more candidates are needed.

### Plans for next month

1. Discussing how to add standalone PlatformIO to project

  * integrating with Eclipse CDT is a longer term project

2. Now looking at future releases

## GNU Tools project

Project lead: Jessica Mills, Embecosm

**Note:** There is some duplication with the report of 30 November 2020, which was the first report to TWG. This month we are able to sync with the monthly reports to the SW TG meeting.

### Progress in current month

* Added multiply accumulate and general ALU operations support to GNU Binutils incl. full testing - in OpenHW repos (Embecosm)
* Added post-increment and register-indexed load/store support to GNU Binutils incl. full testing - not yet in OpenHW repos (UOB/ETHZ)
* Added general ALU operations support to GNU GCC, not tested as awaiting hardware - not yet in OpenHW repos (Embecosm)
* Started adding immediate branching instructions support to GNU Binutils (UOB/ETHZ)
* Added new `-march` option: `xcorevalu` (supports the general ALU operations subset) and `xcorevpostinc` (supports the post-increment and register-indexed load/store operations subset) in binutils and xcorevalu to GCC (UOB/ETHZ and Embecosm)
* Updated [CV32E40P User Manual](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/tree/master/cores/cv32e40p/user_manual)documentation to include all CORE-V extensions
* Formal policy proposal made to support vendor specific extensions
* Proposal made to create the psABI task group with RISC-V International

GNU gcc testing awaits suitable test target

### Risk register update

* Four new risks added:

  * No suitable target to test against - low risk as awaiting delivery of hardware
  * University of Bologna / ETH Zurich cannot get FSF assignment - low risk as mitigation plan in place
  * Insufficient resources to continue work, 15 months of work predicted (8 months from Embecosm an 2 months from UOB/ETHZ provided) - high risk as 5 months work required
  * No mechanism in place in the psABI for vendor specific relocations - low risk as setting up the RISC-V psABI TG is in progress

### Plans for next month

* Add and test CORE-V immediate branching in GNU Binutils (UOB/ETHZ)
* Add CORE-V post-increment and register-indexed load/store support in binutils-gdb to OpenHW repos (UOB/ETHZ)
* Add CORE-V post-increment and register-indexed load/store and immediate branching support to GNU GCC (UOB/ETHZ)
* Finalise GCC testing for CORE-V hardware loops, multiply accumulate and general ALU operations (Embecosm)
* Upstream CORE-V support to binutils-gdb and GCC- awaiting mechanism of psABI vendor specific linker relocations and reliant on successful hardware testing (UOB/ETHZ and Embecosm)

## Clang/LLVM Tools project

Project lead: André S, Thales

**Note:** There is some duplication with the report of 30 November 2020, which was the first report to TWG. This month we are able to sync with the monthly reports to the SW TG meeting.

### Progress in current month

* PPL was accepted

* CVA6

  * None

* CV32E40P

  * Added Hardware Loop support in LLVM integrated assembler
  * Added HWLP support to `clang` (not merged)
  * Added `memcpy` optimization with HWLP (not merged)
  * Added MAC support in LLVM integrated assembler (not merged)
  * Added three `-march` flags (`xcorev`, `xcorevhwlp`, `xcorevmac`) to LLVM (not merged)

### Statistics

None yet

All other risks unchanged.

### Plans for next month
