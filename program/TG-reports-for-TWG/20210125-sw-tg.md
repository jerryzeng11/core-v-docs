# Software TG Report January 2021

Presented to TWG meeting 25 January 2020.

## Overview

Four projects in progress

* **IDE:** Passed PPL gate
* **GNU Tools:** Passed PPL gate
* **Clang/LLVM Tools:** Passed PPL gate
* **FreeRTOS:** Passed PPL gate

## IDE project

Project lead: Alexander Fedorov

### Progress in current month

* Access to HW for Eclipse IDE provided by Quicklogic
* Need for software model now on SW TG agenda as separate project
* Proposal to extend project to include standalone PlatformIO

  * may instead be a separate project.

### Statistics

None yet available

### Risk register update

1. **Risk:** Access to HW for IDE team

   - risk reduced by Quicklogic support and future software models

### Plans for next month

1. Bring up remote HW access
2. Work up PlatformIO proposal

## GNU Tools project

Project lead: Jessica Mills, Embecosm

### Progress in current month

* OpenHW secondment to University of Bologna for binutils work agreed and process to get this in place has begun
* UoB have created a pull request for post-increment and register-indexed load & store in binutils
* UoB continue development on immediate branching in binutils
* Embecosm consolidated tests for HWLP, MAC and ALU to a format agreed by UoB and Embecosm

GNU gcc testing awaits suitable test target

### Risk register update

No changes.

### Plans for next month

* Merge post-increment and register-indexed load & store immediate branching in to OpenHW binutils
* UoB to start work on post-increment and register-indexed load & store and immediate branching in GCC
* Upstream CORE-V support to binutils-gdb and GCC - awaiting mechanism of psABI vendor specific linker relocations and reliant on successful hardware testing
* Find more resource to complete project – 5 engineering months of work required

## Clang/LLVM Tools project

Project lead: André S, Thales

### Progress in current month

* PPL was accepted

* CVA6

  * None

* CV32E40P

   * Clean up code for PRs
   * Add MAC builtins (WIP)

### Risk register update

### Plans for next month

None scheduled

## FreeRTOS project

Acting project lead: Jeremy Bennett, Embecosm

### Progress in current month

* PULP FreeRTOS published on Github under https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-freertos-kernel and https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-freertos
* Unmodified pulp-freertos tested on Nexus A7 - the code making bad memory accesses while configuring the FLL revealed an error in the RTL emulating the FLL - fixed here - https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-mcu/pull/36/commits/7f3402058eda1dce9ca8f75831aab0ea86ae70a8
* A new prebuilt bitstream for Nexus A7 with applied change uploaded at https://github.com/shteryana/core-v-mcu/tree/bitstream-update
* Work on proper timer interrupt configuration ongoing
* Prototyping a more simplified version of pulp-freertos (removing all off the pulp-specific code such as cluster, custim insn, unnecessary abstractions, etc) is ongoing.

### Statistics

None yet

### Risk register update

No change.

### Plans for next month

* Genesys2 pre-built bitstream from latest RTL
* Open repository with basic boot boilerplate
* boot-to-main runtime (`crt0.S`, board initialization)
* Add FreeRTOS kernel and get basic blinky working
