# OpenHW Preliminary Project Proposal
This is a combined proposal for PPL and PL gates of the CV32E40S project

# Title of Project
CV32E40S

## Summary of project
This project involves the creation and verification of the CV32E40S core. This is an evolution of CV32E40P aimed at applications with requirements for security functionality.

CV32E40S is a 4-stage secure RISC-V core supporting the RV32IMCXsecureZce_Zicsr_Zifencei instruction set (see Detailed Feature Requirements).

Compared to CV32E40P, CV32E40S adds the following key features
* Support for User mode 
* Enhanced PMP (ePMP)
* PMA
* Anti-tampering features
  * Protection against glitch attacks
  * Control flow integrity
  * Autonomous (hardware-based, low latency) response mechanisms
* Reduction of side channel leakage

### Components of the Project

The project builds on CV32E40P as a baseline and it shares the following new features with CV32E40X:

* PMA
* Zce extension
* Extended debug functionality
* Simplified pipeline and controller
* Smarter prefetch unit (fewer unneeded prefetches)
* Register file optimization (remove 2nd write port, 3rd read port)
* ALU/MUL clean up
* Faster (mulh*) multiply
* fence.i interface
* mtval support
* Bus error support
* RVFI interface (bound to RTL, not part of actual RTL)

The scope of project is similar to CV32E40P. It consists of design enhancements, verification, and documentation.

Software compiler support will be handled in related OpenHW projects, not yet defined. However, apart for some custom CSRs, no custom instructions will be added and as such software compiler support is expected to be minimal (if not zero).

Support for the (not-yet-ratified) Zce extension would be very welcome from the Software TG, but this PPL/PL does not assume that this will happen.

As of yet any plans to develop OpenHW hardware reference designs such as FPGA or SoC have not been defined.

#### Component 1 - RTL design

The following design aspects of the project are required:

* User mode
* Xsecure (configurable all or nothing)
  * Anti-tampering features
    * Protection against glitch attacks
    * Control flow integrity
    * Autonomous (hardware-based, low latency) response mechanisms
  * Reduction of side channel leakage
* ePMP (configurable number of regions)
* PMA (configurable number of regions)
* Zce extension
* Extended debug functionality
* Simplified pipeline and controller
* Smarter prefetch unit
* Register file optimization (remove 2nd write port, 3rd read port)
* ALU/MUL clean up
* fence.i interface
* mtval support
* Bus error support
* RVFI interface (bound to RTL, not part of actual RTL)

#### Component 2 - Verification

The verification approach is based on that developed for the CV32E40P.

A similar verification approach as for the CV32E40P will be used (UVM, lock step ISS, formal techniques, random code generation, etc.) with the major improvement being a bound RVFI interface to the RTL and an RVVI interface towards the ISS to ease the integration of the core with the verification environment (the RVFI->RVVI scoreboard/adapter is outside the scope of this project). The Imperas ISS will be extended with the new (software visible) features once ratified or deemed stable enough (e.g. User mode, ePMP, Zce, bus error support).

#### Component 3 - Documentation

## Explanation of why OpenHW should do this project

Security is of key importance in IoT. No secure core is present yet in OpenHW roadmap. The CV32E40S could for example be used in a security engine, which can be part of larger SoCs. The CV32E40P does not provide any security related feature and offers no protection at all with resepct to glitch attacks and side channel leakage attacks.

## Industry landscape: description of competing, alternative, or related efforts in the industry

* CV32E40S: Ibex (lower performance, fewer security features, not aligned to core-v-verif verification methodology/standards), 
* ARM SecurCore SC300 
* ARM Cortex-M35P (state of the art, not open source).

## External dependencies

Zce, ePMP, 0.14 Debug specifications have not been ratified yet by RISC-V. Will be deconfigured or postponed if needed.

## List of project outputs

* Verification environment including test cases
* Instruction Set Simulator (ISS)
* Documentation (See Project Documents)

## TGs Impacted/Resource requirements

* Cores TG 
* Verification TG. 

Resource requirements covered within Silicon Labs, Imperas.

## OpenHW engineering staff resource plan: requirement and availability

* Consultancy (answering questions from Project Team on existing RTL or verification infrastructure; likely very minimal)
* Metrics CI support (in principle Project Team will stick mostly to the Cadence world; here we request any Metrics CI work as was done for the 40P)
* Core independent ISS adapter (design of the RVFI->RVVI scoreboard/adapter. The assumption is that a bound RVFI interface is added to the CV32E40P first and that the RVFI->RVVI scoreboard/adapter is specified and designed in the CV32E40P project as well.). The RVFI->RVVI scoreboard/adapter should then be re-usable as-is for the CV32E40S and the Project Team only needs to add a bound RVFI interface to the CV32E40S)
